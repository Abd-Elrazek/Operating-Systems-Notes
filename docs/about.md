# Operating Systems Notes

This documentation regarding all the important OS concepts and notes was taken down by me while undertaking the Operating Systems course at my undergraduate school and also the [Introduction to Operating Systems](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-operating-systems--ud923) course at Udacity. It contains summarized information and key points regarding the main OS concepts. 

You can use these notes as references to quickly revise the basic fundamentals of Operating Systems.
